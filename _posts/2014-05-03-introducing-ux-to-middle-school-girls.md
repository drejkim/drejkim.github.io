title: Introducing UX to middle school girls
tags: ux
---

Last month, I had the privilege of speaking to the girls who participate in GAINS (Girls Achieving in Non-Traditional Subjects) at <a href="https://pms-scusd-ca.schoolloop.com/GAINSProgram">Peterson Middle School</a>. The purpose of the program is to introduce middle school and high school girls to careers where there have historically been less women, such as the STEM-related fields. I've never really spoken about my experiences as a female engineer to a younger audience before, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to introduce them to what I do -- user experience -- and why I like to do it.

The last thing I hoped to do was bore the girls, so I tried to make my talk as interactive as possible. To give them a feel for what user experience is, I discussed a common pain point that we can all relate to... owning a lot of chargers and the resulting tangled mess of wires.

I asked them a few questions:

* Have you encountered this problem before?
* What are some of the issues you have when charging many devices at once?
* What would be some ways to address these issues?

I then showed the product, <a href="http://www.callpod.com/products/chargepod">Chargepod</a>, which was designed to address some of these problems:

And then I asked more questions:

* Do you think this solution addresses some of the issues we mentioned?
* What do you think of the design? Is it cool, not cool?
* Can you think of an even better solution?

The girls were all so very engaged and made some great observations. Then, I told them that this is essentially what I do for a living: I try to understand how people currently use products and come up with solutions that would make the experience simpler and more enjoyable to use. It's more than coming up with cool technology; it's about understanding how to make technology usable, useful, and pleasing for people.

Since the talk was also supposed to address my experiences as a female engineer, I told them that I was never super bothered by the fact that there weren't (and still aren't) very many female engineers. I'd certainly notice from time to time, but I never dwelled on it too much because of my passion for technology. The desire to learn about technology and how to improve it for people has pretty much carried me through my education and career.

Anyway, I hope I was able to get some girls excited about technology and user experience. After all, that was the purpose of my talk!
