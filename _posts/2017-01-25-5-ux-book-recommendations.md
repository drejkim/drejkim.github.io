        The Design of Everyday Things

  <div class="panel-body">
    First published in 1988, this book still holds relevance today. I first read this in graduate school as I began my studies in human factors, and it has really shaped my thoughts on design. Norman provides practical examples and principles to help you design more effectively for the people who use your products.

      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535">
        100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People (Voices That Matter)
      </a>
      <small>by Susan Weinschenk</small>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Susan Weinschenk does a great job of distilling a bunch of psychology research into a collection of 100 facts on how people think, perceive, and act on information. Each principle has a short 2-3 page explanation, which makes it easy to read and to refer to again at a later time.

      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Interviewing-Users-Uncover-Compelling-Insights/dp/193382011X">
        Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights
      </a>
      <small>by Steve Portigal</small>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    When you conduct your first user research interview, you quickly realize that interviewing people is a lot harder than you realized. Because we talk to people everyday, it gives us this false sense that we can elicit the right feedback from users without much training or preparation. This book shows a better way... it provides a great collection of interviewing techniques that will help you gain clearer insights.

And, this is my short list! Happy reading!
