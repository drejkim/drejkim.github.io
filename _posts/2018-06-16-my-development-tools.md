On a number of occasions, I've been asked what tools I use while I code. Here's the short list:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Free code editor from Microsoft
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/): Git GUI
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/): macOS Terminal replacement
* [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/): A dark theme for many things

## Visual Studio Code

My goto editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Code for short). I rarely have to leave it thanks to the integrated Terminal support, which also picks up my shell of choice: [Zsh (Z shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell). It also has extensions for the major languages and frameworks.

## GitKraken

While Code does have basic Git integration, I prefer using a separate Git GUI. I also like having a visual representation of what's happening with Git, which can be obscured when using the command line. I used [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for many years, but recently made the switch to [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). For all my open source coding projects, I use the free version, which has been more than sufficient for my needs.

## iTerm2

The default macOS Terminal is fine, but iTerm2 is better! There are a lot more features and customizations that make it more convenient.

I also have a [separate repo](https://github.com/estherjk/terminal-environment) that I use to configure my Terminal. It's super basic, but it helps me get up and running on a new machine with the Terminal configuration that I like. It's also Terminal agnostic: if I'm on a Linux machine, I can use it there too.

## Dracula Theme

Last, but not least... is the [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/). I like it dark, and the color palette is pleasing to the eye. It also supports many popular tools, including Code, iTerm2, and Zsh.

## Conclusion

Give these tools a try and hopefully they improve your productivity!
