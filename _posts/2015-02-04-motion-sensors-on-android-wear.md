title: Motion sensors on Android Wear

Recently, I was able to get my hands on a Moto 360 and decided to play with the motion sensors. So, I created a demo that displays the raw sensor data and performs simple shake and rotation detection using the accelerometer and gyroscope, respectively. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/drejkim/AndroidWearMotionSensors">GitHub</a>.

See it in action here:
