        I am a UX Researcher & Prototyper at <a href="http://www.intel.com" target="_blank">Intel</a>.
        As part of my job, I've had a chance to work with some of the latest Intel technologies, such as
        <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html" target="_blank">Edison</a> and
        <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html" target="_blank">RealSense</a>.
        My current work is focused on the wearables space.
        Before that, I was a UX Designer at <a href="http://www.sra.samsung.com/" target="_blank">Samsung Research America</a>.

        I really enjoy learning new tools and technologies to enhance both my coding and UX research skills.
        Some recent examples include Android, iOS, machine learning, and data science.
        While I may not be an expert in all of these areas, my goal is to learn, build, and repeat.

        I live in Silicon Valley with my husband, Joe, and our dog, Dash.
        When I'm not coding or researching, I like to spend quality time with my family,
        read just about everything and anything (I try to read a book every two weeks),
        and attempt to exercise regularly.
