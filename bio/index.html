        I really enjoy learning new tools and technologies to enhance both my coding and UX research skills.
        Some recent examples include Android, iOS, machine learning, and data science.
        While I may not be an expert in all of these areas, my goal is to learn, build, and repeat.

        I live in Silicon Valley with my husband, Joe, and our dog, Dash.
        When I'm not coding or researching, I like to spend quality time with my family and
        read just about everything and anything.
