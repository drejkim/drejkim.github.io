        I am a coder and a UX researcher.
        In other words, I build things and test them systematically with users to ensure that the experience is useful and delightful.

        I really enjoy learning new tools and technologies to enhance my skills.
        Some recent examples include iOS, hardware platforms like Intel Edison and Arduino, and new methods for quantifying the user experience.
        While I may not be an expert in all of these areas, my goal is to learn, build, and repeat.

        I live in Silicon Valley with my husband, Joe, and our dog, Dash.
        When I'm not coding or researching, I like to spend quality time with my family and
        read just about everything and anything.
