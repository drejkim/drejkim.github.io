          Whether it's coding an application or conducting user studies, I've always been passionate about building products that people find useful. See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/estherjunkim">LinkedIn</a> for more details on my experience.

          I also really enjoy learning new technologies and sharing what I've learned with others by <a href="/blog">writing</a> and <a href="/projects">creating projects</a>.

          When I'm not thinking about technology, I like to <a href="http://drejkim.com/reading-quantified">read</a>, post photos of my dog on <a href="https://instagram.com/dashkimthedog/">Instagram</a>, and spend quality time with my family.
