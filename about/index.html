      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I like to create <a href="/projects">open source projects</a> and <a href="/blog">write</a> about them.
        I am particularly interested in making things that combine hardware and software, that go up and down the stack, or are in emerging areas like AI and IoT.
        By sharing code and documentation, my goal is to learn and share knowledge.
      </p>
